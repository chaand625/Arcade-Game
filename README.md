    I downloaded the project from the link provided by the Udacity. I have read all the comments in JavaScript files.

#### Bulding the Game

+ I found some errors in developer console and then resolved those errors, then I got the canvas

+ I have added properties to the Enemy class like positon and speed

+ As needed I have created a Player class and provided necessary functions like update, render and handleInput

+ For checking the collisions, I have added checkCollisions method to enemy class

+ For increasing fun among the players I have also added score to the game

+ I have given random speeds such that speed doesn't go out of control

    I have enjoyed developing this game. It is very interesting. I have learned few more concepts in the Object Oriented JavaScript.
